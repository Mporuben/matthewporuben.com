# About me
So... Who am I? I don't like long and boring BIO's full of buzzwords. So I'll try to show you who am I on 
some things that I care about.
  
::

## Teamwork
It's most essential for me to provide value for people around me by doing my work. 
In my experience as a Labmaster (teacher) & member of team, by providing right amount of facilitation we
empowers team to the best performance 

## Technology
I am a huge fan of the web stack. I'm not talking only about "websites" but the whole ecosystem of hybrid apps that runs on every device.
As a developer, I love sharpening tech stack and working towards simpler and more concise code. I'm also trying my know-how share with people. 
I've multiple public presentations and workshops on the topic of front-end & it's architecture.
