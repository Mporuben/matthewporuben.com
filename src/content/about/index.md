## Teamwork
It's most essential for me to provide value for people around me by doing my work. 
In my experience as a Labmaster (teacher) & member of team, by providing right amount of facilitation we
empowers team to the best performance 

## Technology
I am a huge fan of the web stack. I'm not talking only about "websites" but the whole ecosystem of hybrid apps that runs on every device.
As a developer, I love sharpening tech stack and working towards simpler and more concise code. I'm also trying my know-how share with people. 
I've multiple public presentations and workshops on the topic of front-end & it's architecture. 


## Programming
I've started programming when I was 15. Writing JS was fun for me since day 1. Now after more than 7 years, I've to say 
In school, I've tried all kinds of languages like Java, Python, PHP, etc... My secondary language back in the days was Java. 
I love programming because it enables me to make things that make life easier.
